# South African ID Document Processing Project Plan

## Current Status (January 31, 2024)

### Dataset Preparation (Completed)
- Successfully merged and processed datasets:
  * Total Images: 101
  * Training Set: 80 images
  * Validation Set: 21 images
  * Format: 800x800 JPEG
  * Annotations: COCO JSON format

### Categories (Finalized)
1. Field Categories (11):
   - id_document
   - surname
   - names
   - sex (New ID only)
   - nationality (New ID only)
   - id_number
   - date_of_birth
   - country_of_birth
   - citizenship_status
   - face
   - signature (New ID only)

2. Corner Points (4):
   - top_left_corner
   - top_right_corner
   - bottom_left_corner
   - bottom_right_corner
