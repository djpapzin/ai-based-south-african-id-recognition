# Plan for Detectron2 Model Training

## 1. Data Preparation ✓ (Completed)

### 1.1. Data Inspection and Validation ✓
   - Verify the correctness of the exported COCO data by inspecting the JSON structure, image paths, bounding box data, labels, and consistency.
   - Address any issues identified by making changes to the annotation and data preparation process.

### 1.2. Data Splitting ✓
   - Create a script to split the annotated dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Implemented 80-20 split ratio for training-validation.
   - Created and validated COCO format JSON files for each split.

### 1.3. Data Format Conversion ✓
    - Ensured data is in correct format for Detectron2.
    - Validated COCO files structure and content.
    - Implemented logging for conversion process.
