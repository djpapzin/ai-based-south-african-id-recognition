## 1. Project Overview
The goal is to develop an AI system for recognizing and extracting metadata from South African ID documents:
- Traditional green bar-coded ID book
- New smart ID card

### Key Requirements
- 99% accuracy in document type classification
- 1% maximum error in metadata extraction
- 10-second maximum processing time per document
- POPIA compliance for data handling

## 2. Current Progress

### Completed Step 1: Document Classification
- Successfully trained classification model on 600+ images
- Labels: New ID vs Old ID document types
- Model performing as expected
- Provides foundation for field detection

### Current Step 2: Field Detection
#### Current Dataset
- Total Images: 66
  * Training Set: 53 images
  * Validation Set: 13 images
- Label Characteristics:
  * 12 labels per image (fields within ID)
  * No duplicate labels
  * Includes both rectangle and keypoint labels
- Status: Initial training in progress

### Technical Progress
- Phase 1 (Completed):
  * Successful document classification model (600+ images)
  * OCR baseline testing (Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR)
  * Determined pure OCR approach insufficient
  * Research findings:
    - Separate models (classification + detection) recommended for accuracy
    - Processing speed can be optimized later
    - Normalization required for precise corner detection

- Phase 2 (Current):
  * Field detection model training
  * Using Detectron2 for object detection
  * Enhanced labeling approach:
    - Corner point detection for normalization
    - Consistent field naming convention established
    - Initial timing estimate: ~22 images per day

### Labeling Process Improvements
- Enhanced Annotation Strategy:
  * Corner points for document normalization
  * Standardized field names across team
  * More precise than simple bounding boxes
  * Coordination between team members for consistency

### Time Estimates
- Current labeling speed: ~22 images per day
- Manual labeling estimate (500+ images): 2-3 days
- Team coordination:
  * Abenathi joining for labeling support
  * Standardized process documentation
  * Quality control measures

## 3. Technical Implementation

### Current Focus: Field Detection
- Model: Detectron2 with ResNet50-FPN backbone
- Purpose: 
  * Field location detection (surname, name, DOB, etc.)
  * Corner point detection for ROI
- Status: Training in progress

### Planned Pipeline
1. Object Detection (Current)
   - Detect and classify all fields
   - Identify corner points

2. Label Studio Integration
   - Use trained model to pre-label 500+ additional images
   - Human verification workflow
   - Fallback to manual labeling if accuracy insufficient (2-3 days)

3. Model Refinement
   - Retrain with expanded dataset
   - Implement OCR for text extraction
   - Generate final results
