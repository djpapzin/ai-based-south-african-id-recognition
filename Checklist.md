# Checklist for Detectron2 Model Training

## Data Preparation

- [x] Perform a data inspection of the generated JSON COCO file.
- [x] Validate all aspects of the JSON structure, the paths, the annotations, the labels and image sizes.
- [x] Verify that all the JSON data is in line with your expectations.
- [x] Create Python script for splitting the annotated dataset.
- [x] Split dataset into training and validation sets (90-10 ratio).
- [x] Verify the image paths are correct in all generated datasets.
- [x] Save train and validation sets into JSON format.
- [x] Convert the data to the correct format for detectron2.
- [x] Use logging to ensure each of the steps in the data conversion process works as expected.

## Detectron2 Training Script
