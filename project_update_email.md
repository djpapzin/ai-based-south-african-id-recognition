Subject: ID Recognition Project Update - Progress and Demo Timeline

Hi Rob and Willem,

I wanted to update you on our progress and propose a strategic shift in our approach.

Current Progress:
- Successfully trained initial model on 101 verified images
- Model Performance Highlights:
  * Overall Accuracy (AP50): 91%
  * Strong performance on ID document (88.9%), face (72.4%), and DOB (65.9%)
  * Areas needing improvement: Sex (33.4%) and Signature (34.4%)

Challenges Faced:
- Dataset merging issues with keypoint detection
- Power outage interrupted testing of pre-labeling capabilities
- Time spent on dataset preparation affecting overall timeline

Strategic Shift Proposal:
Instead of focusing on expanding the dataset now, I propose we build a complete end-to-end demo pipeline first. This would include:
- Image upload interface
- Document classification (Old ID vs New ID)
- Field detection and extraction
- OCR text extraction
- JSON output with extracted data and confidence scores

Timeline:
1. Weekend Development (Jan 31 - Feb 2)
   - Pipeline integration (Detectron2 + OCR)
   - Initial testing
2. Monday Morning (Feb 3)
   - Demo presentation
   - Review and feedback

I will work through the weekend to ensure we have a working demo ready by Monday morning. This will give us a concrete foundation to build upon and help identify practical integration challenges early.

Please let me know if you agree with this approach or have any concerns.

Best regards,
DJ
