AI-Based South African Identity Document Recognition System 

1. Project Overview 

The project aims to develop an artificial intelligence system capable of accurately recognizing and extracting metadata from both the traditional South African ID book and the new smart ID card formats. This system will support legitimate identity verification processes while maintaining high security and privacy standards. 

2. Scope of Work 

2.1 System Development 

The contractor shall: 

Develop an AI model capable of recognizing and distinguishing between:  

Traditional green bar-coded ID book 

New smart ID card 

Implement robust image processing capabilities to handle various lighting conditions, angles, and image qualities 

Extract name, identity number and date of birth for each document into JSON format 

Ability to extract and save the photograph of the participant for further processing in facial recognition 

2.2 Technical Requirements 

Minimum 99% accuracy in document type classification 

Minimum 1% error in metadata extraction rate 

Maximum 10-second processing time per document 

Ability to handle common image formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF) 

Error handling for poor quality images with appropriate user feedback 

2.3 Data Requirements 

The contractor must: 

Keep sample documents provided for training confidential 

Implement data augmentation techniques to expand training dataset 

Ensure compliance with POPIA regarding data handling 

Maintain detailed documentation of data sources and usage
