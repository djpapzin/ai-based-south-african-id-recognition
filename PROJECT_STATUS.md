# South African ID Document Detection - Project Status

## Latest Update: February 5, 2025

### Current Status
Project Status: SA ID Recognition

### Implementation Progress
- ✅ Dataset preparation complete with train/val splits
- ✅ Detectron2 model configuration set up with Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN backbone)
- ✅ Training script optimized for quick demo (500 iterations)
- ✅ GPU acceleration enabled by default
- ✅ Category ID handling and validation implemented
- ✅ Bounding box validation checks added

### Technical Details
- Model: Faster R-CNN with ResNet50-FPN backbone
- Dataset: 35 valid images with 1003 instances across 12 categories
- Training Parameters:
  - Batch Size: 4 (optimized for quick demo)
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Max Iterations: 500
  - Evaluation Period: 100 iterations
  - Checkpoint Period: 100 iterations

### Known Issues
- Category IDs in annotations do not start from 1 (handled by Detectron2's automatic mapping)
- Initial CUDA errors being addressed with proper validation checks

### Next Steps
1. Complete quick demo training
2. Evaluate model performance
3. Fine-tune hyperparameters if needed
