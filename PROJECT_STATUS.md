# South African ID Document Detection - Project Status

## Latest Update: February 4, 2025

### Current Status
Currently implementing Keypoint R-CNN model for South African ID document field and corner detection. The model is being trained on a dataset of 66 images (53 training, 13 validation) using Keypoint R-CNN with ResNet50-FPN backbone, configured for both field detection and keypoint estimation.

### Recent Achievements
1. Dataset Preparation:
   - Merged and validated 101 images
   - Split into 80 training/21 validation
   - Standardized to 800x800 JPEG format
   - COCO JSON annotations with 15 categories

2. Training Setup:
   - Configured Detectron2 with ResNet50-FPN
   - Set up TensorBoard monitoring
   - Implemented proper dataset registration
   - Added visualization functions

3. Dataset Enhancement:
   - Converted to keypoint format with 66 validated images
   - Split into 53 training/13 validation
   - Preserved aspect ratios for better quality
   - COCO JSON annotations with keypoints

4. Model Configuration:
   - Switched to Keypoint R-CNN architecture
   - Configured custom keypoint head
   - Implemented corner point detection
   - Added proper keypoint visualization
